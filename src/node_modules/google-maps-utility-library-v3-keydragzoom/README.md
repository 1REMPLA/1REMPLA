### Purpose:

Google code's hosting of http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/tags/keydragzoom/2.0.9/src/keydragzoom.js as a resource no longer works. Also this project does not seem to have been forked anywhere yet (via this [list](http://googlemaps.github.io/libraries.html)). Therefore this lib is being published here to work with bower and npm.
